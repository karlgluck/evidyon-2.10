Yes, there will be more classes.  I hope to release 2 but up to 4 new classes before beta:

[b]Hunter[/b] - Ranger/thief/rogue with woodland abilities such as tracking players by their footsteps, spying from afar, shapeshifting into monsters combined with wielding fast, lethal attacks.
[b]Leyshaper[/b] - Uses the environment for offense and defense.  Special attributes include reflecting projectiles, absorbing/redirecting physical and magical damage, creating illusions (fake walls/objects/people), summoning minions, creating portals, self duplication, invisibility, polymorphing (into objects), phasing through walls and more.
[b]Artisan[/b] - Crafter class.  Although all classes can add special properties to items and wield them, the Artisan derives his or her abilities almost entirely from the items wielded and is able to see properties of items at a much deeper level.  For example, what appears to be a bronze sword with +1 ability level to a non-artisan, the Artisan may see as a +1 ability level sword that grants him or her the ability to cast Multi Ignis and Whirlwind.  With sets of items equipped in combination, Artisans can get almost any ability from other classes (and some abilities no other class gets!)  Artisans are also the only source of Evidyon's equivalent to the LSA and magic bag, and are able to craft all sorts of other potions, charms and amulets.

[b]cleric-y type class[/b] - I haven't really thought about this one, but it's needed.  General buffs/healing class.





easy stuff to add:
- footstep sounds
- button-click sound
- special fx targeter that locks in on scenery (to create special items)
- beam spell
- vertical shaking spell



ADD MORE MAP

fixed for 2.9.1 (mini-update):
- mouse cursor changes for casting spells.  weird side effect: when you click on something to attack it, the mouse flips
- high level monsters drop items now!
- the bug where you don't stop moving after releasing the mouse button is fixed
- put putesco back at level 7 for Sorcerers but reduced the damage
- extended the length of all buff spells to 5-6 minutes
- if the server goes down while you're still connected, the server will definitely
  save your character in its current state and will gracefully disconnect you
  (you won't be left hanging with a frozen client)


fixed for 2.9.0:
======================================================
- items stay on map for longer
- items on ground don't mistakenly disappear anymore
- can't walk through walls
- new "old skool" sword mouse cursor
- icons for enchantments
- sound fx volume decreases with distance
- sounds pan left/right
- spawning special fx to warn of monsters coming on-screen
- fixed bug that was spawning monsters en mass around characters
- physical hit sound (and special effect!) fixed a bit
- swirling particle effect (divinus)
- fixed memory leak in special FX manager
- fixed lag when clicking on a character in account screen
- new item types, lots of new items


- confirm delete character

  ACTORWEAPON_PIKE,
  ACTORWEAPON_BIGGUN, // lol :D
  ACTORCOMBAT_NINJA_LOW,
  ACTORCOMBAT_GODLIKE, // float in air...
};


- have animation "profiles" for each combat state
- must be able to copy profiles! actors w/o profiles should be easy to create...
->list o' profiles...


class ActorCombatProfile {
public:
  dc::dcEnum<ActoCombatState> state;

 - teleport swap

 - 2 second reflect all projectiles spell
 - mirror (1 sec) - turn attacks on source, disable own attacks
 - nightfall - darken area
 - shadowjump: teleport without special effect
 - bind : mark target HP when bind starts; reduction in own HP steals
          HP from target to regenerate when bind ends.  (increase in
          own hp increases target HP to reduce)
 - summon pet
 - follow: you go to the same place as a portaling player
 - shadowwalk: teleport to a random location where you've been before



A player doesn't drop ANY ITEMS AT ALL if PKed by someone who is one of their last
five PKers:
  - if you kill one of your last PKers, it's REVENGE
      > they always drop an equipped item
      > they are removed from your last pkers list
  - if you kill someone not on your last PKers list, the list is cleared. this
    makes it so that continual pkers can be killed...over and over and over...
    
      

Instead of banning a player, just "hobble" them--make it so that they can't talk
and can't cast spells on or attack any other player




BALANCING FACTOR FOR COMBAT
let 'f' be a percentage greater than or equal to 0
the damage that one PLAYER deals to another PLAYER is:
    dmg = raw + balancing
    raw = dmg * (1-f), minimum zero
    
    balancing = min( (percent damage dealt of attacker's hp) * (target's hp), f * dmg)
    balancing = min( (dmg / attacker_hp) * target_hp, f*dmg )
    
'f' is based on the difference in attacker/target levels:
f = (a - b)^2 / (a^2+b^2)

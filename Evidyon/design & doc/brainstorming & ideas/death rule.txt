 - share storage for account
 - when die, never drop items on you:
	-> sum up value of equipped items
	-> sum up value of inventory
	-> drop inventory and enough items from storage to make up the value of the equipped item(s) that *would* have been dropped


clone item?  grab "design" from character to make your own!!!

the key is not to give players who pay a PVP/leveling advantage over those who don't, but instead
to give them perks.  maybe paying customers dont lose exp when they die?

$5 makes a character immune to EXP loss for life

 - when a character dies & loses EXP, use platinum to buy back the experience.  platinum can be obtained
   primarily via payment and is nontransferrable

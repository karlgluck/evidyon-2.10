each god contributed 1/4 of the power to make the world, leaving each vulnerable.  xendra is trying
to get genite back from the world in order to increase her own power

each item has a "genite potential" and an "infused genite" value; the potential is a maximum, by
imbuing an item with genite, it gets more abilities.  by sacrificing an item with a genite potential,
you set the maximum genite potential you have with a certain god.

the more genite your items are worth, the more genite it costs to resurrect you

- world is created in the celestial realm, and placed in the mundane plane after creation.  Normally,
  Gods can't use their full power in this plane (just as life can't progress in the celestial realm).
  Geosids are an extension of the celestial realm that allow the God that created the Geosid to use
  his or her power more fully in the world.  For example, to bring new players into existence.  Other
  effects such as removing players (i.e. logging off) or casting spells can occur anywhere, since
  these are relatively minor effects.  Long-range transport is achieved via the Geosids.


Of the many deities in the celestial realm, known to the people of Ertia are four.  The Creators, or
Sources as they are sometimes called, together conceived this world and its inhabitants to test their
skill against one another to help pass their time in eternity.  Unlike similar contests past, these
four agreed to only act indirectly upon the world to increase the challenge.

Combining their power, the four jointly forged the world each contributing their specialty.  Atragus
covered the planet with forests and water, and bestowed life; Faynix formed the sky and bestowed
intelligence; Thronden conjured items and implemented judgement; and Xendra bestowed rank, memories,
history and social structure.  Finally, all four infused the planet with magic, breathing Genite into
every part.  With that, the world began and life moved forward.  Cities blossomed; towns bustled;
caravans and sailing ships carried goods along their trade routes.  For millenia, the world, though
never completely at peace, was productive and the Gods were proud of their work.

Xendra, however, quarrelled with the others; she wished to have more control over the world's
inhabitants.  She began to influence leaders, speaking into their minds to do what she thought was
best.  As she began influencing the world more and more directly, the other three Gods took exception
and demanded she cease.  Not to be thwarted, she revealed a secret development: the Geosid.  Sending it
to the planet, she could use her full power anywhere nearby to conjure allies, destroy enemies and
create items.  However, the Geosids draw their power by sapping genite from the world.  To avoid
destroying everything nearby, objects containing genite must be regularly sacrificed to a geosid
to keep it alive.  Thus, Xendra bade her minions to sap the world of its most powerful and Genite-
rich items so she could expand her power in the world by sustaining more Geosids.

Atragus, Faynix and Thronden feared for the wellbeing of the world's inhabitants, having grown quite
attached to them over the millenia.  In quick response, they began sending their own geosids to the
world.  At Nexius, the largest town in the northern hemisphere, they established the Core, a trio
of Geosids they would use to help the world resist the influx of Xendra's minions and maintain
their magical world.  Each has the power to bring minor deities that offered to give up their
celestial status into the mortal realm.  [[these are the client player characters]]

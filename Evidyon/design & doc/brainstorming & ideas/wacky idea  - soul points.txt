wacky idea:  don't lose EXP when you die & respawn;  you lose "soul".  When your soul points decrease to 0, your character is dead.
to bring the character back, you must venture with another character on your account to the end of a dungeon to resurrect him.
a character gains a soul point each time he or she levels; soul points don't apply to characters under level 10 (thus, all characters
start with 10 soul points)

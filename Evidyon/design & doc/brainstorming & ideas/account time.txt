for every level a character gains, you get 1 day of account time

issues:
=======

 - high level chars will powerlevel their noobs for account time then delete them, and repeat
 - create level 1, level to 2, delete, repeat (about 10 mins of work for 1 day of acct time = 30 days in 300 mins...)
	* but this is a lot of work just for some account time!


benefits:
=========

 - encourages low-level characters since they're easier to level
 - even high-level characters will need noobs since high-level chars level more slowly




another idea:
=================
gain level * level modifier




another idea:
==================
when a character gains a level, your account time won't drop for that many more days:

ex:  gaining level 30 on a character means the account time won't drop for 30 days




another idea:
==================
when you help another person?

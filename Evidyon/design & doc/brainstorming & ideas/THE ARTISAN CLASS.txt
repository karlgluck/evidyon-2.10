can make items that have an "affinity" for that artisan
	-> artisans have "trade names" given (generated by the server) when after they apprentice with a town artisan
		-> town artisan can imbue items for all players
	-> must use a town workshop to work items

no item have level requirements, but may have stat requirements
sometimes, when the artisan creates/imbues an item, a special power is added that only the artisan can use
	-> for example, the artisan creates a wizard staff that, if the artisan can equip it,
	   grants the ability to cast magic missle at will
	-> or a sword that bestows the talent of "spin"
	-> or a bow that allows the user to multishot
	-> a wand that allows three spells to be cast
	-> a ring that gives the ability to heal
	-> a ring that adds the teleportation spell
the artisan must have the requisite MP to use the spell/skill; it acts just like a regular spell,
	but it's only available when the artisan has that item equipped.  Thus, if the artisan cannot
	equip it, he or she cannot use the ability.

crafted items have higher abilities

ex. item:
	Singing Bow
		1-8 damage

	Malius's Singing Bow
		3-12 damage
		Adds Multishot (Malius only)
		+6 to bow skill (Malius only)

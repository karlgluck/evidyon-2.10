instead of buying account time, users could buy platinum.  platinum can be used to purchase
things in-game such as special titles for your character, new armor effects, and other
fun stuff that doesn't really affect the game but is kinda cool.

$1 = 367 platinum

platinum is only rarely obtained by killing monsters.

to obtain new items players must barter.  they put up items in the
bazaar, list a price (in pecnia/pesnia or platinum), and people can buy them.

occasionally, the system will "buy" items listed in the bazaar.  This causes
the items to be recycled into the system; they are removed from circulation entirely.







this "bazaar" could tie in nicely to the system of deaths:  if a player is killed, whomever
loots their "ear" could take this item to the bazaar and obtain one of the items the player
is saleing at a steep discount

projectile spells and projectile weapons have both precision and accuracy:

 precision - how much variance there is in the projectile's angle when targeted
 accuracy - how wide the targeting range is

these are governed by the mastery levels of the ability for precision/accuracy
vs. the player's skill levels.  these could be some examples...


Bow Precision - max affected mostly by intelligence, a little agi
Bow Accuracy - max affected mostly by agility, a little int



Projectile Precision - max affected by intellgence, a little wisdom
Projectile Accuracy - max affected by wisdom, a little intelligence

	the greedy talisman is an item that prevents you from dropping
	any equipped items when you die (or those that would have been
	pulled from storage).  however, after it is used, it will
	unequip a random item (move it from equipped -> inventory).  the
        greedy talisman disappears when you die & respawn.

	the disadvantage here is that if you die in a hostile area,
	resurrect, and die again before equipping the item, it will
	drop the item that was unequipped.

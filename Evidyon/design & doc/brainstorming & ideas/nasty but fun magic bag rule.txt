Magic Bags will keep your gear equipped if you die and do not disappear if

you die w/ EXP loss.  However, there is a small chance that the bag will "return

to its owner" when used, and will both disappear and steal a random item

from the player with it equipped.  This item will randomly be equipped to a

boss character, be put in a chest or be distroyed (50% chance of destruction).

The model uses bone animation via interpolation u need to adjust the fps/ticks in ur engine
for the individual sequences. 

Idle 0-6
Death 7-15
ClawAttack 16-23
Move 24-27

Issues: MDL7 seem to have troubles with interpolation based animation though conitec
will upgrades to to a new better format soon.

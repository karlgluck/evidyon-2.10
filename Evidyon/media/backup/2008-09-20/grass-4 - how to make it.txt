steps to making this grass texture:

1 - find a good grass texture on the web
2 - paste into photoshop
3 - set resize sampling mode (file->preferences->general) to sample nearest, instead of bicubic (which is default)
4 - resize to 1/2 size in each dimension
5 - resize back to full size (picture should be slightly grainy)
6 - create duplicate layer
7 - copy texture into 4 quadrants of a texture 2x as big in each dimension
8 - apply filter "Filter -> Noise -> Reduce Noise" with these settings:
	strength: 	  	highest (10)
	preserve details:	lowest (1%)
	reduce color noise:	highest (100%)
	sharpen details:	lowest (0%)
9 - copy original sized picture from center of big image, then offset by 1/2 in each dimension (to restore original picture)
10- using duplicate layer, copy into 4 quadrants of texture 2x as big in each dimension
11- apply filter "Gaussian Blur" using whatever looks good
12- copy original sized image from center of big image, but don't offset this time (makes the image more random!)
13- now you should have a picture with the reduced-noise layer on bottom, and the blurred layer on top.
    multiply-blend the blurred layer into the reduced-noise layer
14- merge down, apply color balancing to achieve desired effects!  this texture should be rotationally-tileable
    in all 4 quadrants (don't ask why this works, but it does!)
